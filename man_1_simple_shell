.SH NAME
simple_shell \- Is a program interpreter in between the standard input and the Linux kernel.
.SH SYNOPSIS
[command] [options 1] [options 2] ... [options n] [direcotry path to apply command]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The simple shell program is a CLI (Command Line Interface) that was coding in C language and allow the user access through the keyboard to the Linux Operating System. The purpose of this project is put into practice all knowledge got in the first trimester of basic formation in Holberton School.

.SH COMMANDS AND EXAMPLES
Simple shell allow the execution of the Linux operative system commands. Also include some built-in options like: 

Directory management:

        $ cd [directory path]  = Change to a specific directory.
        $ cd ..                = Change to pathern directory.
        $ cd or cd ~           = Change to home directory.

Exit and error management:

Exit status is in between 0 and 255. Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands are also limited to this range. Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special values to indicate specific failure modes, like:

         __________________________________________________________
        | Value |                    Meaning                       |
        |-------|--------------------------------------------------|
        |   0   |  Successful command execution                    |
        |-------|--------------------------------------------------|
        |   2   |  Missing keyword, command, or permission problem |
        |-------|--------------------------------------------------|
        |  127  |  Possible problem with $PATH or a typo           |
         ---------------------------------------------------------- 

For the simple shell purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. A non-zero exit status indicates failure. This scheme is used to indicate success and a variety of ways to indicate various failure modes. All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage, generally invalid options or missing arguments. If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127.
It is possible to stop the program execution using the system signal Ctrl + D. 
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
When a program is invoked, it is given an array of strings called the env. This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value. The values are given at the beginnig of the bash shell, and are modified when the program is running. The environment variables are information about configuration and statement parameters of the system. For example some important parameters are: actual directory (PWD), system language (LANG) and actual user(USER). That information will change with your operative system. To print the env array in this shell type: 

        $ env

.SH COMMENTS
